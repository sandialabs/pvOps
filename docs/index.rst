Overview
============
pvops is a python package for PV operators & researchers. 
It consists of a set of documented functions for supporting operations 
research of photovoltaic (PV) energy systems.
The library leverages advances in machine learning, natural
language processing and visualization 
tools to extract and visualize actionable information from common 
PV data including Operations & Maintenance (O&M) text data, timeseries 
production data, and current-voltage (IV) curves.
